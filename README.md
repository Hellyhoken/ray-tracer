# ray-tracer

Raytracer based on Peter Shirley's tutorial "Ray Tracing in One Weekend". With the added functionality of using 50x50 ```.png``` files as textures for planes.

Renders into ```.png``` format.

```troll_render.png``` contains the rendered result of the current code setup. 

Shapes can be added, removed or modified by chaning the ```spheres``` and ```planes``` arrays in ```main()```.
